    dtc: Warning rather than error on possible truncation of cell values

    We always evaluate integer values in cell arrays as 64-bit quantities, then
    truncate to the size of the array cells (32-bit by default).  However to
    detect accidental truncation of meaningful values, we give an error if the
    truncated portion isn't either all 0 or all 1 bits.  However, this can
    still give counterintuitive errors.  For if the user is thinking in 2's
    complement 32-bit arithmetic (which would be quite natural), then they'd
    expect the expression (-0xffffffff-2) to evaluate to -1 (0xffffffff).
    However in 64-bit it evaluates to 0xfffffffeffffffff which does truncate
    to the expected value but trips this error message.

    Because of this reduce the error to only a warnings, with a somewhat more
    helpful message.
