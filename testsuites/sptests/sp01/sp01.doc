concepts:

+ Verifies executive initialization performed correctly.

+ Verifies system can create and start both the executive's system
  initialization and idle task.

+ Verifies executive can swap between three application tasks at the
  same priority and the executive's internal idle task.

+ Verifies can print strings using stdio and BSP console support.

+ Verifies interrupt support can handle a task switch from an interrupt.

+ Verifies that a task can get the task identification number of itself.

+ Verifies implementation of SuperCore TOD_MILLISECONDS_TO_TICKS.  Normal
  computation in applications is via a macro at the Classic API level.
