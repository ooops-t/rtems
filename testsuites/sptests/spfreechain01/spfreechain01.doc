This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  spfreechain01

directives:

  _Freechain_Initialize
  _Freechain_Put_node
  _Freechain_Get_node
  my_freechain_extend_with_nothing
  my_freechain_extend_heap
  my_freechain_extend_workspace

concepts:

+ Ensure that the freechain operations listed above behave as defined.
+ Define 3 freechain extension handles, they are:
  my_freechain_extend_with_nothing: a dummy extension handle, do nothing
  my_freechain_extend_heap: an extension handle allocates memory from heap
  my_freechain_extend_workspace: an extension handle allocates memory from workspace
+ Ensure that the freechain is extended correctly by user provided extension handles
