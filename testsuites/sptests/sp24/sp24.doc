This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  test24

directives:
  ex_init, ex_start, t_create, t_start, tm_tick, i_return, t_ident,
  ev_receive

concepts:

  a.  This test is a cyclic version of test1.  The times printed by
      each test should not skew as in test1 (see output section).

  b.  Verifies system can create and start both the executive's system
      initialization and idle task.

  c.  Verifies executive can swap between three application tasks at the
      same priority and the executive's internal idle task.

  d.  Verifies can print strings to the CRT on port 2 of the mvme136 board
      using Print and Println in the board support package.

  e.  Verifies interrupt handler can handler a task switch from an interrupt
      as specified with the i_return directive.

  f.  Verifies executive initialization performed correctly.

  g.  Verifies the executive trap handler except for the halt function.

  h.  Verifies that a task can get the task identification number of itself.

output:
  "TA1" is printed once every 5 seconds.  "TA2" is printed once
  every 10 seconds.  "TA3" is printed once every 15 seconds.

  The times printed should be multiples of 5 seconds for TA1, 10 seconds
  for TA2, and 15 seconds for TA3.  If this does not happen, the calendar
  time does not correspond correctly to the number of ticks.
