This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  sp76

directives:
  + rtems_task_wake_after - yield case when non-preemptive

concepts:

+ This test is specifically designed to exercise the yield case when
  a task is non-preemptive, a higher priority task is ready, and there
  are multiple threads ready at the same priority as the non-preemptive
  task.

+ test where there is more than one thread at a priority with the executing thread being non-preemptive. Create a higher priority thread and then yield. sparc init task at priority 2, non-preemptive create task at priority 2 create task at priority 1 yield
