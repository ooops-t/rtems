test set name: utf8proc01

directives:
- utf8proc_errmsg()
- utf8proc_version()
- utf8proc_iterate()
- utf8proc_encode_char()
- utf8proc_get_property()
- utf8proc_decompose_char()
- utf8proc_decompose()
- utf8proc_reencode()
- utf8proc_map()
- utf8proc_NFD()
- utf8proc_NFC()
- utf8proc_NFKD()
- utf8proc_NFKC()

concepts:
- Call interface methods of library utf8proc in order to make sure they are
  compiled and linked ok.
- The library is third party, thus it should be sufficient for us to make sure
  we can build it correctly.
