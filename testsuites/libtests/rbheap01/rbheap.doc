This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: rbheap01

test_init_chunk_alignment:

test_init_begin_greater_than_end:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_initialize

concepts:
  + verifies RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS is returned when the beginning address is
    larger than the ending address.

test_init_begin_greater_than_aligned_begin:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_initialize

concepts:
  + verifies RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS is returned when the beginning address has a
    negative offset from an address aligned with the pagesize.

test_init_aligned_begin_greater_than_aligned_end:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_initialize

concepts:
  + verifies RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS is returned when the beginning address has a
    positive offset from the ending address.

test_init_empty_descriptors:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_initialize

concepts:
  + verifies RTEMS_NO_MEMORY is returned when attempting to initialize an rbtree
    to an empty descriptor

test_alloc_and_free_one:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate
  + rtems_rbheap_free

concepts:
  + allocates and frees a red-black-tree

test_alloc_zero:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate

concepts:
  + verifies that the allocating no memory for a red-black-tree returns a
    NULL pointer

test_alloc_huge_chunk:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate

concepts:
  + verifies that the allocating more memory than is available for a
    red-black-tree returns a NULL pointer

test_alloc_one_chunk:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate
  + rtems_rbheap_free

concepts:
  + verifies that allocating one chunk of memory from an rbheap returns memory
  + verifies that one chunk of memory can be freed

test_alloc_many_chunks:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate
  + rtems_rbheap_free

concepts:
  + verifies that allocating eight (8) chunks of memory from an rbheap returns
    memory
  + verifies that one chunk of memory can be freed

test_alloc_misaligned:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate

concepts:
  + verifies that rtems_rbheap_allocate returns NULL (does not allocate memory)
    if the size allocated is not aligned with the pagesize

test_alloc_with_malloc_extend:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate
  + rtems_rbheap_initialize
  + rtems_heap_greedy_allocate
  + rtems_heap_greedy_free

concepts:
  + allocate as much memory as possible
  + verify no more can be allocated
  + free as much memory as possible
  + verify memory can be allocated again

test_free_null:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_free

concepts:
  + verify RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL is returned when freeing a NULL pointer

test_free_invalid:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_free

concepts:
  + verifies freeing a non-zero rbheap fails with RTEMS_INVALID_ID

test_free_double:
directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate
  + rtems_rbheap_free

concepts:
  + verifies allocating an rbheap returns memory
  + verifies freeing a heap twice fails with RTEMS_INCORRECT_STATE

test_free_merge_left_or_right:

NOTE: test_free_merge_left_or_right should probably be broken into
test_free_merge_left and test_free_merge_right...

directives:
  + rtems_rbheap_allocate
  + rtems_rbheap_free

concepts:
  + allocates 5 rbheaps and frees memory in different ways

TODO: break into different tests
