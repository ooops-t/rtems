This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  psxenosys

directives:

  aio_suspend
  clock_getcpuclockid
  execl
  execle
  execlp
  execv
  execve
  execvp
  fork
  pthread_atfork
  pthread_getcpuclockid
  sched_setparam
  sched_getparam
  sched_setscheduler
  sched_getscheduler
  wait
  waitpid
  mprotect
  vfork

concepts:

+ Ensure that various routines which RTEMS provides but returns -1 and sets
  errno as ENOSYS behave as expected.

+ Ensure that the stub implementations of mprotect() and vfork() operate
  as expected.
