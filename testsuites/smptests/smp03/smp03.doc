This test runs the init task on the first CPU at a priority
of 5.  The Init task creates tasks for each remaining processor
at priorities ( 5 + (2*CPU) ).  It then creates one more
task at a priority of 3 wich should preempt the last task created.
The Init task waits on the last task to run then ends the program.

Each created task prints the cpu and task that it is running.  Then
checkes the task id to see if it is the final task.  If it is the
final task, a flag is set for the Init task to see.
