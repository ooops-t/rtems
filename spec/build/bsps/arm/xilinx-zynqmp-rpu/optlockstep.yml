    In lock step mode, the ATCM and BTCM can be used together as a contiguous
    memory region.  In this case, we set the ATCM size to the combined size,
    the BTCM size is set to zero, and the ZYNQMP_MEMORY_ATCM_OR_BTCM
    environment variable is set to ATCM.  In split mode, the ATCM and BTCM are
    separate memory regions.  In this case, the ZYNQMP_MEMORY_ATCM_OR_BTCM
    environment variable is set to BTCM.  The ZYNQMP_MEMORY_ATCM_OR_BTCM
    environment variable is used by the linker script to select memory regions.
