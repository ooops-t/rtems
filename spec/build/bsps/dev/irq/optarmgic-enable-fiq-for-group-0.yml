  This option enables the use FIQ interrupts for GIC group 0 interrupts.  The
  ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) variants GICv1 with Security
  Extensions, GICv2 without Security Extensions, GICv2 with Security Extensions
  and in Secure processor mode, GICv3 and GICv4 in Secure processor mode, GICv3
  and GICv4 with GICD_CTLR.DS == 1 have the ability to assign group 0 or 1 to
  individual interrupts.  Group 0 interrupts can be configured to raise an FIQ
  exception.  This enables the use of NMIs with respect to RTEMS.  Use
  arm_gic_irq_set_group() to change the group of an interrupt (default group is
  1, if BSP_ARM_GIC_ENABLE_FIQ_FOR_GROUP_0 is defined).  To use FIQ interrupts,
  you have to install an FIQ exception handler and enable FIQs in the Current
  Program Status Register (CPSR).
