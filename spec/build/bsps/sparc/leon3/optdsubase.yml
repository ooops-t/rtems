  This option defines the base address of the DSU register block used by
  the clock driver and CPU counter implementation.

  In general, using the Debug Support Unit (DSU) is not recommended for the
  clock driver and CPU counter implementation.  Before you use it, check that
  it is available in flight models and that the time tag register is
  implemented in radiation hardened flip-flops.  For the GR712RC, this is the
  case.
