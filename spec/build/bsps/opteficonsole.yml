description: |
  Select preferred EFI console. Possible values are TEXT, GRAPHIC, BOTH and AUTO. The TEXT here will instruct RTEMS to use EFI simple text output protocol. By default
  EFI also forwards such text output to configured serial port. Details depends on the target platform EFI configuration.
  The GRAPHIC instructs RTEMS to use EFI graphics output protocol. Advantage of it
  in comparison with TEXT is that it is available also in the time when boot services
  are already finished. BOTH tells RTEMS to mirror its output to both TEXT and GRAPHIC. This only
  applies to platforms where both options are supported. The option which is not supported
  on target platform is ignored in the RTEMS runtime and only available option is used. Finally AUTO tells RTEMS to use output console
  preferred by the target platform configuration. In case RTEMS is not able to retrieve EFI console control protocol interface, then BOTH
  is used instead of AUTO.
